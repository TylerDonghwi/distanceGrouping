// Each job is represented by an array of coordinates eg. [x, y]
// There are n number of technicians that can complete those jobs,
// There is a limit to a number of jobs that a technician can do, suppose it is m,
// We want to assign each job to a technician such that the total distance traveled by technicians is minimum
// Ideally we want every technicians to have similar number of jobs
// give me an algorithm to calculate that in javascript
